# 🧠 Smart AI Photo Cleaner

**Instantly find and delete duplicate photos.**  
_Clean up your library, free up storage, and keep only your best memories — smarter and faster!_

> All scanning and processing happen locally on your device. Your photos are never uploaded, ensuring full privacy and security.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Lightning-fast scanning**  
  Analyze thousands of photos in seconds with efficient batch processing and Core ML models.

- 🗂️ **Organized by category**  
  Automatically group your photos into:
  - Selfies
  - Portraits
  - Screenshots
  - General Photos

- 🧠 **Smart duplicate detection**  
  Uses image embeddings + cosine similarity to find similar or repeated photos.

- 🔒 **Private & Secure**  
  All processing happens on-device — no cloud, no upload, 100% privacy.

- 🧹 **Easy bulk cleanup**  
  Select categories or groups and remove clutter with just a tap.

- 📊 **Real-time results**  
  Instantly see the number of duplicates found by category and monitor progress.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift + SwiftUI  
- **Frameworks:** CoreML, Vision, Photos  
- **Model:** Core ML model (e.g. ResNet50 Headless, FastViT)  
- **Similarity:** Cosine similarity between image embeddings  
- **Persistence:** Codable JSON (local storage)  
- **UX:** Clean, categorized UI with live scan & deletion interface

## 🛡️ Privacy First

- No photo leaves your device  
- No cloud or external API required  
- Full on-device AI processing with Apple CoreML

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Fetches assets from photo library using `PHAsset`
2. Extracts image embeddings with CoreML (`VNCoreMLRequest`)
3. Calculates similarity via cosine distance
4. Groups similar photos using graph clustering
5. Presents duplicates for user to review, keep, or delete
